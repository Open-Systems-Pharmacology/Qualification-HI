Drug specific parameters were fixed from the healthy lidocaine PBPK model. Physiological alterations within hepatic impairment were applied to the model and simulations were conducted for virtual patients with classified as Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh C.  Virtual populations with liver disease were created according to the patient demographics of study participants within the study conducted by Orlando, Piccoli (50). [Table 30](#table_30). provides the patient demographics of participants incorporated within the study by Orlando, Piccoli (50) used to develop the virtual hepatic impairment populations.

**Table 30. HI population demographics for lidocaine IV administration** <a id="table_30">

| Child-Pugh| Dose and Administration| Cohort (n)| Age (Years)| Weight (kg)| Height (cm)| BMI (kg/m2)
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| A | 1 mg/kg IV administered over 1 minute | 10/20 | 55±7 | 82±10 | 172±6 | 27±2.3| 
| C | 1 mg/kg IV administered over 1 minute | 10/20 | 54±9 | 79±8 | 170±7 | 28±2.7| 

A visual representation of the HI-PBPK lidocaine simulations for Child-Pugh A and C may be found in Figure 3.19 and Figure 3.20, respectively.
