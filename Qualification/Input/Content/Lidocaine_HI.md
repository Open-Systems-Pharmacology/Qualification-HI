#### Oral model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used within the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh Score. A population with Child-Pugh A, B and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled in the studies by Brockmöller, Thomsen (18) (Table 2).

**Table 2. HI population demographics for levetiracetam oral administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) | 1000 mg single dose PO | European male patients Child-Pugh A | 5 | 50 ± 8 | 89 ± 16 |
| Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) | 1000 mg single dose PO | European male patients Child-Pugh B | 6 | 53 ± 5 | 87 ± 12 |
| Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) | 1000 mg single dose PO | European male patients Child-Pugh C | 5 | 51 ± 6 | 74 ± 3 |

Simulated population HI-PBPK models of levetiracetam administered as 1000 mg oral single dose in patients with Child-Pugh A-C are presented in Figure 1, 2 and 3.
