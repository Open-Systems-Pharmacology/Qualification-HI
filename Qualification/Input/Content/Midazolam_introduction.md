Midazolam is a benzodiazepine used to induce drowsiness and anxiety relief before surgery and certain procedures. The drug is also indicated for the management of acute seizures. Midazolam acts through increasing the activity of GABA to produce sedative effects.

In this section, the general ADME ([Table 13](#table_13)), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for midazolam are described.

| BCS classification | I |
| -- | -- | 
| Linear kinetics    | Yes, between 0.15 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg IV doses; non-linear at 0.45 mg/kg and 0.6mg/kg doses. |
| Plasma half-life   | 3 hours [Range: 1.8-6.4 hours] |
| fe,unchanged       | Urine: 0.011-0.028% (27) |
| Bioavailability    | >90% determined from IM administration |
| Distribution       | 94% protein bound. Volume of distribution ranges from 1-3.1 L/kg |
| Metabolism         | Metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4 |
| Clearance          | 0.25-0.54 L/h/kg |

The midazolam healthy PBPK model was based on the development by Hanke, Frechen (5) with an application of CYP3A4 and UGT1A4 metabolism and glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with hepatic impairment to simulate the pharmacokinetics of midazolam across the disease spectrum.
