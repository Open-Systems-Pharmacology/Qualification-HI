Drug specific parameters were fixed from the healthy theophylline PBPK model. Physiological alterations within hepatic impairment were applied to the model and simulations were conducted for virtual patients with classified as Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C.  Virtual populations with liver disease were created according to the patient demographics of study participants within the study conducted by Froomes, Morgan (46). Study participant weight was not recorded within the study by Froomes, Morgan (46) therefore average height, weight, and BMI we incorporated by PK-Sim based on the corresponding age. [Table 26](#table_26) provides the patient demographics of participants incorporated within the study by Froomes, Morgan (46) used to developed the virtual hepatic impairment populations.

To evaluate the theophylline HI-PBPK model, predicted clearance (mL/min) and half-life (h) were compared to the observed values for Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C. As no observed data was available from study participants, a simulated concentration vs. time profile for each Child-Pugh stage is not shown. Evaluations were conducted on the PK parameters previously stated. The comparisons may be found in [Table 26](#table_26).
