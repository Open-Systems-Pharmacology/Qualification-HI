#### IV model

Metoprolol physicochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (20). [Table 10](#table_10). presents the drug specific parameters of metoprolol and the values used within the healthy adult IV model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple IV PK studies described in the metoprolol report (30) and Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (20).

#### Oral model

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple oral PK studies described in the metoprolol report (19) and Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (20).  Absorption parameters in the oral model included metoprolol tartrate tablet described by a Weibull distribution with dissolution half-time of 12.31 min and shape 0.72.
