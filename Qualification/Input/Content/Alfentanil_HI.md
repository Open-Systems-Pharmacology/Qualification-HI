Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic used for the treatment of patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization (11, 12). The mechanism of antiseizure activity has not been fully elucidated, however animal models have shown that levetiracetam binds to synaptic vesicle proteins SV2A modulating neurotransmitter release (13). 

In this section, the general ADME (Table 6.), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for levetiracetam are described.

[Table 5](#table_5).

**Table 5. HI population demographics for alfentanil IV administration** <a id="table_5">

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort (sample size)** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus	| HI population: European with estimated Child-Pugh B and C based on reported information (plasma albumin concentrations and total bilirubin)   (45% female, n = 11) | 	56 [39-69]	| 60 [43-73] | 
|Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus | Control population: European (n = 10)	| 45 [24-66] | 59 [34-84] |


Simulated pharmacokinetics of alfentanil after a single IV bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg in Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C are presented in Figure 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Simulations of the average healthy control are included in each figure for visualization.
