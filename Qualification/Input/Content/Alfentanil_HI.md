#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used within the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh Score. A population with Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled in the study by Ferrier, Marty (10) (Table 5).

**Table 2. HI population demographics for alfentanil IV administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus | HI population: European females (45%) and males with estimated Child-Pugh B and C | 11 | 56 [range: 39-69] | 60 [range: 43-73] |
| Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus | Control population: European | 10 | 45 [range: 25-66] | 59 [range: 34-84] |

Simulated pharmacokinetics of alfentanil after a single IV bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg in Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C are presented in Figure 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, respectively. Simulations of the average healthy control are included in each figure for visualization.
