With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used within the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh Score. A population with Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled in the study by Ferrier, Marty (10) [Table 5](#table_5).

**Table 2. HI population demographics for alfentanil IV administration** <a id="table_5">

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort (sample size)** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus	| HI population: European with estimated Child-Pugh B and C based on reported information (plasma albumin concentrations and total bilirubin)   (45% female, n = 11) | 	56 [39-69]	| 60 [43-73] | 
|Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus | Control population: European (n = 10)	| 45 [24-66] | 59 [34-84] |


Simulated pharmacokinetics of alfentanil after a single IV bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg in Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C are presented in Figure 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Simulations of the average healthy control are included in each figure for visualization.
