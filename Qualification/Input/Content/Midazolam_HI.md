#### IV model

##### MacGilchrist et al. 
Drug specific parameters were fixed within from the healthy midazolam PBPK model. Physiological alterations within hepatic impairment were applied to the model and simulations were conducted for virtual patients with stages of liver impairment classified as Child-Pugh A to C, corresponding to the patient demographics in the study by MacGilchrist, Birnie (31). Child-Pugh prognostication was not documented within this study, and limited clinical variables were reported to fully assess Child-Pugh status. Based on the clinical variables that were reported (i.e., total bilirubin, albumin), the study population likely consisted of patients representing each Child-Pugh classification. Therefore, for the population HI-PBPK model simulations for intravenous midazolam each Child-Pugh score was evaluated against observed data. Additionally, predicted clearance (mL/min/kg) and elimination half-life (h) was compared to control subjects. Participant demographics included within the study by MacGilchrist, Birnie (31) used for population PBPK simulations may be found in [Table 15](#table_15).

Simulated population HI-PBPK models of intravenous midazolam administered to patients with Child-Pugh A-B within the study by MacGilchrist, Birnie (31) are presented in Figure 3.8 - Figure 3.10. Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters may be found in [Table 16](#table_16).

#### Pentikainen et al. 

Similarly, a population HI-PBPK model was developed and evaluated against observed data from the pharmacokinetic study conducted by Pentikäinen, Välisalmi (32). Those with cirrhosis within this study were not prognosticated using the Child-Pugh classification criteria. As a result, estimations were made based on the report clinical characteristics (i.e., total bilirubin, albumin and presence/absence of ascites). Patients within this study were likely classified as Child-Pugh B or C using the aforementioned clinical characteristics alone. As a result, population HI-PBPK simulations of midazolam were conducted for both Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh C. Additionally, predicted AUC∞ and clearance (mL/min/kg) were compared against the observed values from patients within the study. Study participants demographics used for creation of the population HI-PBPK simulations may be found in [Table 17](#table_17).

| Study | Dose and administration | Cohort (sample size) | Age (years) | Weight (kg)

#### Oral model

#### Pentikainen et al. 
Study participants within the study by Pentikäinen, Välisalmi (32) were given an oral dose of midazolam (15 mg) three days after receiving the bolus injection. As described above, virtual individuals with hepatic impairment as described by Child-Pugh B and C were created within an oral midazolam population HI-PBPK model. The resulting concentration-time profiles are found in Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14, respectively. Study participants included within this study underwent a three-day washout period after IV administration prior to receiving oral midazolam. As a result, patient demographics included within the oral midazolam population HI-PBPK model may be found in [Table 19](#table_19). 

Additionally, model evaluation was assessed by determining the fold-error between predicted and observed AUC∞ and maximum concentration (Cmax). The comparison of simulated versus observed values within the study by Pentikäinen, Välisalmi (32) are found in [Table 19](#table_19).
