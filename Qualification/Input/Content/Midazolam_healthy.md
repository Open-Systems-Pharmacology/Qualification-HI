Midazolam physicochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Hanke, Frechen (5). Table 14. presents the drug specific parameters of midazolam and the values used within the healthy adult model.

The healthy PBPK model development by Hanke, Frechen (5) was based on PK studies by Hohmann, Kocheise (28), Hyland, Osborne (29), and Thummel, O'Shea (30).    .
