Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, approved for use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. It exhibits its vasodilatory effects by promoting the accumulation of intracellular cGMP, resulting in the enhancement of nitric-oxide mediated vasodilation (33, 34).

In this section, the general ADME [Table 20](#table_20), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for sildenafil are described.

The sildenafil healthy PBPK model was based on the development by Open Systems Pharmacology (37)  with an application of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 mediated clearance. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with hepatic impairment to simulate the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil across the disease spectrum.
