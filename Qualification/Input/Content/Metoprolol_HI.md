#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used within the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh Score. A population with Child-Pugh B and C were created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled in the study by Regårdh, Jordö (24) ([Table 11](#table_11)). 

Child-Pugh prognostication was not documented within this study, and limited clinical variables were reported to fully assess Child-Pugh status. Based on the clinical variables that were reported (i.e., total bilirubin, albumin), the study population likely consisted of patients being classified as Child-Pugh A and B. Therefore, the population HI-PBPK model simulations for both intravenous and oral consisted of Child-Pugh A and B. Additionally, predicted AUC∞ was compared to observed AUC∞ ([Table 12](#table_12)).
