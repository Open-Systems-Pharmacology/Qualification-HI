#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used within the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh Score. A population with Child-Pugh B and C were created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled in the study by Regårdh, Jordö (24) (Table 2). 

Child-Pugh prognostication was not documented within this study, and limited clinical variables were reported to fully assess Child-Pugh status. Based on the clinical variables that were reported (i.e., total bilirubin, albumin), the study population likely consisted of patients being classified as Child-Pugh A and B. Therefore, the population HI-PBPK model simulations for both intravenous and oral consisted of Child-Pugh A and B. Additionally, predicted AUC∞ was compared to observed AUC∞ (Table 3).

### Oral model

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple oral PK studies described in the metoprolol report (19) and Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (20).  Absorption parameters in the oral model included metoprolol tartate tablet described by a Weibull distribution with dissolution half-time of 12.31 min and shape 0.72. 


Simulated PK of metoprolol administered as 50 mg oral single dose in patients with Child-Pugh A and B presented in **Figure 3** and **Figure 4**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed AUC<sub>∞</sub> from patients enrolled in Regårdh, Jordö (35) is presented in **Table 4**.
