Sildenafil was included within the HI-PBPK model evaluation as a representative substrate of CYP219, CYP2C9, along with CYP3A4. The healthy model as developed by OSP (37) was altered with physiological parameters seen with liver disease. The population HI-PBPK model was evaluated with the pharmacokinetic study conducted by Muirhead, Wilner (38). This study included participants with biopsy confirmed hepatic cirrhosis, classified with Child-Pugh A and B. Twelve participants were enrolled within the pharmacokinetic analysis, 7 being Child-Pugh A and 5 being Child-Pugh B. Study participant demographics used for the population simulations may be found in [Table 22](#table_22). 

**Table 22. HI population demographics for sildenafil PO administration** <a id="table_22">

| Study | Dose and administration | Cohort (sample size) | Age (years) | Weight (kg) |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Muirhead, Wilner (38) | 50 mg by mouth as a single dose | N= 12 patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh A: 7/12 Child-Pugh B: 5/12 | 32-63 | NR


The developed sildenafil population HI-PBPK model was assessed against the average concentration-time profiles of study participants. Model simulations for Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B may be found in Figure 3.15 and Figure 3.16, respectively. Additionally, predicted versus observed AUC∞ and Cmax was evaluated. These results, along with the evaluations for control subjects may be found in [Table 23](#table_23).
