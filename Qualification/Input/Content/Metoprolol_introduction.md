Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta-1-adregenic receptor inhibitor that competitively inhibits beta1-receptors specific to cardiac cells. It is approved for the treatment of angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and hypertension. 

In this section, the general ADME ([Table 9](#table_9)), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for metoprolol are described.

| BCS classification | I |
| -- | -- | 
| Linear kinetics    | Plasma concentrations in patients with angina pectoris were linearly related to oral doses of 50-400 mg. |
| Plasma half-life   | 3-7 hours |
| fe,unchanged       | >95% of oral dose recovered in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Urine IV: 10%; PO: 5%. |
| Bioavailability    | Absorbed over a large part of the gastrointestinal tract. F is normally 100%, but can reduce to 40% in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (21). |
| Distribution       | Distributes rapidly between blood and extravascular with 1-2% of total drug amount localized in blood at apparent distribution equilibrium. 12% are bound to plasma proteins (22). |
| Metabolism         | Extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 as the primary enzyme. |
| Clearance          | Mainly excreted by the kidneys, 0.8 L/min (23) |

The metoprolol healthy PBPK model was based on the development by RÃ¼desheim, Wojtyniak (20) with an application of CYP2D6 metabolism and glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with hepatic impairment to simulate the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol across the disease spectrum.
