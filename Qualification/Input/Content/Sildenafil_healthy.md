Sildenafil physicochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Open-System Pharmacology (37). [Table 21](#table_21). presents the drug specific parameters of sildenafil and the values used within the healthy adult model.

The clinical data used to develop the sildenafil PBPK model may be found within the Open-System Pharmacology Evaluation Report.
