Lidocaine is approved for use as a local anaesthetic and as an antiarrhythmic drug. In addition to its anesthetic and antiarrhythmic properties, it may also be used as an analgesic. The analgesic effects of lidocaine are thought to be due to the inhibition of spontaneous impulses generated by the injured nerve fibres. (47) 

In this section, the general ADME ([Table 28](#table_28)), the healthy PBPK model, and translation to a population with HI for lidocaine are described.

| BCS classification | N/A |
| -- | -- | 
| Linear kinetics | Potentially exhibiting non-linear kinetics with increased doses (48) 
| Plasma half-life | IV: 1.5-2.0 hours (48)
| fe,unchanged | Urine: ~10% as unchanged drug (48)
| Bioavailability | 1.0 (IV administration) (48)
| Distribution | Average volume of distribution 0.8 to 2.8 L/h/kg (48); Fraction unbound: 0.3 (49)
| Metabolism | Metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP 3A4 (48, 50)
| Clearance | IV: 10.0 â€“ 18.2 mL/min/kg  (48) 


The following lidocaine PBPK model applies CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 metabolism, in addition to renal clearance via glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults will serve as the base model when adapting the physiological parameters within hepatic impairment. Simulations of the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine in Child-Pugh A and C were conducted.
