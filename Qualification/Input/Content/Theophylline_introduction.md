Theophylline is a methylxanthine that is administer either orally or intravenously for the management of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (39). Theophylline induces its bronchodilatory effects through antagonism and inhibition of the adenosine and phosphodiesterase pathways, respectively (40, 41).

In this section, the general ADME ([Table 24](#table_24)), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for theophylline are described.

| BCS classification | N/A |
|--|--|
| Linear kinetics | Potentially exhibiting non-linear kinetics only at very high doses (43) |
| Plasma half-life | IV: 4.8-6.7 hours (44)| 
| fe,unchanged | Urine: 14-17% (44)|
| Bioavailability | 0.96-0.99 (44)|
| Distribution | Average volume of distribution in patients receiving analgesia with alfentanil is 0.5 L/h/kg (44). Fraction unbound: 0.28 (45)|
| Metabolism | Metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP 2E1 (46)|
| Clearance | IV: 0.057-0.072 L/h/kg (44) |


The following theophylline PBPK model is based on that developed by Britz, Hanke (12) applying CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 metabolism, and renal clearance by glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults will serve as the base model when adjusting physiological parameters endured within hepatic impairment. Simulations of the pharmacokinetics of theophylline in patients with various disease severity was conducted.
