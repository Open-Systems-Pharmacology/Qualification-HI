Alfentanil physicochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Hanke et al. [5] [Table 4](#table_4) presents the drug specific parameters of alfentanil and the values used within the healthy adult intravenous model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on eight single dose IV PK studies described in the alfentanil report (4). These doses consisted of 0.015 mg/kg, 0.02 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, and 1 mg.
